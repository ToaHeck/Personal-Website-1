            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>Welcome to my portfolio website! I am To'a Heck, a senior at 
                California State University - East Bay, set to graduate in the
                fall of 2023. As a person of Polynesian descent with Samoan and
                Tongan heritage, I am proud to represent my culture in the tech
                industry. Unfortunately, there is a lack of representation of the
                Polynesian population in tech, which makes my role even more 
                important to me.
            </p>
               
            <p>Currently, I work at Topcon Positioning Systems in Livermore, CA as 
                an IT Applications intern. My responsibilites include creating IT solutions for
                customers as well as managing and maintaining user databases.
                One of the projects I am currently working on is reviewing legacy code for an application
                written in Classic ASP. I've spent the last couple of months blueprinting the web app and 
                in the coming weeks, I will begin to migrate it to the ASP.Net suite.
                Through this experience, I have gained expertise in server-side scripting 
                and how ADO objects are created and maintained to update a database.
            </p>
                
            <p>During my free time, I love to indulge in my creative pursuits, which include
                playing the guitar, working out at the gym, and designing artwork using 
                tools like Photoshop, After Effects, Blender, and Premiere Pro. As an artist,
                I have had the opportunity to create compelling artwork for musical artists, 
                such as album art, music videos, and concert posters. If you would like to
