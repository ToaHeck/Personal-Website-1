            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>My name is To'a Heck and I am currently a senior
                at California State University - East Bay. I will be
                graduating in the fall of 2023 and am very excited.
                I am half Samoan and half Tongan, making me of Polynesian
                descent. I am proud of my culture and am privilaged to
                represent it in the tech industry as I have noticed that
                there is very little representation of the Polynesian population
                in tech.
                </p>
               
                <p>I currently work at Topcon Positioning Systems
                in Livermore, CA as an IT Applications intern. My job consists of
                reviewing old code written for web aplications in Classic ASP as well as 
                completing and triaging Jira tickes. I have learned
                server-side scripting as well as how ADO objects are created and
                maintained to update a database.</p>
                
                <p>In my free time, I enjoy playing guitar, training 
                in the gym, and creating artwork within Photoshop, After Effects,
                Blender, and Premiere Pro. In the past, I have been commisioned to
                create artwork for musical artist. This consists of album art, music
                videos, and concert posters. Here's a link to my instagram where you can
